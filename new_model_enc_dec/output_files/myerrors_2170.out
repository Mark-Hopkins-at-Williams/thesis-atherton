Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.

/mnt/storage/aatherton/anaconda3/envs/nmt/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models/encoder_decoder/modeling_encoder_decoder.py:642: FutureWarning: Version v4.12.0 introduces a better way to train encoder-decoder models by computing the loss inside the encoder-decoder framework rather than in the decoder itself. You may observe training discrepancies if fine-tuning a model trained with versions anterior to 4.12.0. The decoder_input_ids are now created based on the labels, no need to pass them yourself anymore.
